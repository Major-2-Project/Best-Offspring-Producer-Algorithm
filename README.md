# Best-Offspring-Producer-Algorithm
Abstract

In order to obtain best solutions, we need a measure for differentiating best solutions from worst solutions. The measure 
could be an objective one that  is  a  statistical  model  or  a  simulation, or  it can be a subjective  one where  we  choose  better  solutions 
over worst  ones. Apart from this the  fitness function determines a best  solution for a given problem, which is subsequently used  by 
the GA to  guide the evolution of best solutions. This paper shows how GA is combined with various other methods and technique to 
derive optimal solution, increase the computation time of retrieval system the applications of genetic algorithms in various fields.
